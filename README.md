## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python (3.9+)
* Node.js and npm
* Git
* A running MySQL server

### Backend Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ruping04/AI-Dashboard-Project.git](https://github.com/ruping04/AI-Dashboard-Project.git)
    cd AI-Dashboard-Project/backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Set up your environment variables:
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` folder.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if you have one) or add the following, filling in your own credentials:
        ```ini
        MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
        MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        MYSQL_HOST=localhost
        MYSQL_DB=smart_notes
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
        # You'll also need to set up Google Cloud Authentication for Vertex AI
        ```
5.  Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal:
    ```sh
    cd AI-Dashboard-Project/frontend
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
